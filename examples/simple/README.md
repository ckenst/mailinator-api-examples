# Simple Examples

If you are new, start here. 

The goal with this directory is to demonstrate Mailinator's API using simple, self contained http requests. Everything needed is in the file (except for your API key).

## Run

0. Make sure you have your Mailinator API key in the .env file
1. Look over the tests domain (public vs private), inbox name (everything vs specific), parameters
2. Run the test `node examples/simple/nameOfFile.js`
